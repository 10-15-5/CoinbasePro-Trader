# CoinbasePro-Trader

Very simple program that will buy a specific amount of crypto at a certain time, it then gets the details of the transaction and writes to a .txt file.

Uses the cbpro python client to interact with the Coinbase API

** Will soon be adding a feature where it will send a text through a Telegram bot every time a transaction occurs
