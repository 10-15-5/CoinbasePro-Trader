# CoinbasePro-Trader

Very simple program that will buy a specific amount of crypto at a certain time, it then gets the details of the transaction and writes to a .txt file.

Uses the cbpro python client to interact with the Coinbase API

It also gets details about how much was bought and for how much and sends an sms through a Telegram bot informing the user.
